// Server and Client Connection IDs:
//
// The server primarily uses the dcid (Destination Connection ID) to identify incoming connections.
// The client primarily uses the scid (Source Connection ID) to identify itself to the server.
//
// Handler Objects:
//
// There is one Handler object per dcid. The Handler object manages the overall connection associated with that dcid.
//
// Stream Objects:
//
// There is a Stream object for each logical_id within a connection. Each Handler object manages multiple Stream objects, one for each active stream within the connection.
//
// Here is a summary of how these components interact:
//
// When a new connection is initiated, a Handler object is created and associated with the dcid.
// The Handler object manages the connection and handles incoming packets, delegating stream-specific tasks to Stream objects.
// Each Stream object is responsible for handling the data and state associated with a specific stream within the connection.
//
// This design allows the server to efficiently manage multiple connections and streams, with each Handler object managing a single connection and each Stream object managing a single stream within that connection.

    //    OR the StreamIdentifier maps to a single URL/Request that can be used to open a new Stream.
