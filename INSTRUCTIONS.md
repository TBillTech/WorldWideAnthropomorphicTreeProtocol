## During this Session

Focus: Finish C.2 Node mock + kick off C FFI Phase 2
- C.2: finalize Node WebTransport mock semantics parity and wire it to the in-memory server mock for system tests.
- C FFI (Phase 2): replace stub with real backing in `quic_connector_c.cc`, link to `QuicConnector`, and start a minimal Node binding (N-API preferred) with a POC test.
Relevant TODO sections: `js_client_lib/TODO.md` → C.2 and C.2 Investigation bullets.

Relevant `TODO.md` is under path: js_client_lib
Relevant `README.md` is under path: js_client_lib

## Before you start
- Carefully read the relevant `TODO.md` for open tasks (check root and relevant subfolders).
- Carefully read the relevant `README.md` (or `Readme.md`) for project details that aren’t obvious from code.
- Skim top-level configs to infer stack and workflows (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt`, `package.json`, test configs).

## How to work
- Extract explicit requirements into a small checklist and keep it updated until done.
- Prefer doing over asking; ask only when truly blocked. Make 1–2 reasonable assumptions and proceed if safe.
- Make minimal, focused changes. Don’t reformat unrelated code or change public APIs without need.
- Validate changes: build, run tests/linters, and report PASS/FAIL succinctly with key deltas only.
- After ~3–5 tool calls or when editing >3 files, post a compact progress checkpoint (what changed, what’s next).
- Use delta updates in conversation—avoid repeating unchanged plans.

## Prioritization
- Prioritize items in `TODO.md` matching what we are working on during this session. If unclear, suggest small, high-impact fixes or docs/tests that clarify behavior, and get confirmation from the user.  Note that sometimes the task is to just update the `TODO.md` or add research findings to a `README.md`.

## Deliverables
- Provide complete, runnable edits (code + small test/runner if needed). Update docs when behavior changes.
- When commands are required, run them yourself and summarize results. Offer optional copyable commands.
- Wrap filenames in backticks, use Markdown headings and bullets, and keep explanations brief.

## Quality gates
- Build: no new compile errors.
- Lint/Typecheck: clean or noted exceptions.
- Tests: add/adjust minimal tests; ensure green.

## Style
- Keep it concise and impersonal. Use clear bullets and short paragraphs. Avoid filler.

## After you Finish

- If you made any code changes, ALWAYS run unit tests.
- If there are ANY unit test failures, try hard to fix them all. If this seems too difficult consult with the user and get detailed about debugging.
- If you made any code changes, update the TODO.md and check all completed tasks.
- Update the session conversation summary at the end of TODO.md.
- Update the README.md with any findings that appeared during the session which are worth remarking on.  Be sure to preserve any solutions to command line issues, so we don't have to repeat broken command lines in the future.
- Update these `INSTRUCTIONS.md` by replacing the "During this Session" with a concise and simple guess for the most reasonable next steps. This should usually direct the agent to the matching section in `TODO.md`. If there is no matching section in `TODO.md`, instead add a warning.
- Finally, commit all file changes.
